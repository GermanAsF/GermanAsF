Less German than he pretends to be.
Work is not the focus of my life.

Senior network systems and project engineer.

Not a programmer by trade, mostly likes to mess around with stuff.

Intersted in 3D printing, electronics, general CAD & graphics sillinesses.
Pretends to be able to play the guitar, but hasn't touched one in almost 5 years.
